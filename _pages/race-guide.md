### How the scores work

Each race is evaluated on three factors, combined into a weighted overall score:

- **Sub-3:00 %** — The percentage of all finishers who crossed the line under 3 hours. This is the most direct measure of how "fast" a race is and carries the most weight in the overall score.
- **Course** (out of 100) — Rates how fast the course profile is. Flat courses score highest (Valencia: 98, Berlin: 98), while rolling or hilly courses score lower (NYC: 70, Boston: 75).
- **Weather** (out of 100) — Rates how favorable typical race-day weather is for fast times. Cool, dry, low-wind conditions score best (Valencia: 92, Berlin: 90), while variable or warm conditions score lower (Boston: 70, Amsterdam: 75).

Note that large-field races like Berlin and Chicago rank lower in sub-3:00 percentage because their massive fields include many charity and casual runners — even though they produce the highest *absolute count* of sub-3:00 finishers (Chicago: 2,410, Berlin: 1,750). Smaller, more competitive fields like REVEL Big Cottonwood naturally have a higher percentage of fast finishers.

### What about sub-2:40?

Unlike sub-3:00, which is the standard benchmark tracked across all major races, sub-2:40 finisher data is not comprehensively published by most race organizers. From the data that is available, Valencia and Boston consistently lead in both percentage and absolute count of sub-2:40 finishers. At Valencia, roughly 30% of men under 45 finish sub-3:00, and the race also produces among the highest concentrations of sub-2:45 finishers (~1,500 men annually). For races like NYC, the sub-2:40 count among men under 40 was ~318 in 2024. As a rough rule of thumb, sub-2:40 finishers typically represent about 15-25% of the sub-3:00 count at any given race.
