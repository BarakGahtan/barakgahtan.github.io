I’m Barak Gahtan, a PhD candidate at Technion University leveraging deep learning to analyze physiological signals and optimize high-throughput network communications. My research spans estimating VO₂ consumption from wearable data, predicting heart rate from video, and designing hash-based clustering frameworks to DNA storage applications, and optimizing communication networks parameters from encrypted traffic to signals controlling teleoperated vehicles. Outside the lab, I enjoy family time, coaching runners, exploring new trails, and training for my next marathon.
