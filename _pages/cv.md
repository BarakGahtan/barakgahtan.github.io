Work Experience
======

* **Hauwai Research Intern 2023-2024** 

  Part of the innovation team on building an ML-based scheduler for data-center switching. During my internship at Toga Networks, I implemented a deep reinforcement learning solution for optical circuit switching matching. The goal of the project was to create a system that, given a demand matrix, can decide in real-time which ports to use to satisfy the data while distinguishing between direct and indirect links.

* **Accenture Research - Research Intern 2022-Summer** 

  I worked as an intern as a research engineer at Accenture Labs. I created a data-driven machine learning model that uses the CVSS calculator for CVEs to calculate the severity of a CWE-Product-Vendor triple. In addition, we used CYBERT and BERT to build two NLP models, one based on key words and the other using semantics, to create links between Capecs and different attack techniques in the SMESH knowledge graph.

* **YAHOO Research - Research Intern 2021-2022** 

  I was a research engineer intern at Yahoo Research, and I was part of the Scalables team. My project was integrating Persistent Memory (PMem) capabilities into an open-source cache, Caffeine. We developed Robusta as a wrapper around Caffeine. It is a hybrid cache leveraging PMem and DRAM to get the best of both worlds: DRAM-like low latency for frequent items, reduced tail latency thanks to Pmemâ€™s high capacity, and a warm start on recovery from failures. Robusta can have different policies for where it is possible to place values. The code can be found in my Git. The paper can be sent upon request.

* **IBM Research Labs - Software Engineer Intern 2019-2021** 

  I was a member of the Hybrid Cloud Quality Technologies department. I worked on several projects, some more data science-oriented, such as parallel execution of jobs, and others, such as automatic code generation of tests, while using different open-source tools such as Evosuite and Randoop.

* **Talmor School for Psychometrics 2015-2019**
